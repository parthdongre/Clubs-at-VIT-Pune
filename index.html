The institute is home to over 40 technical, cultural, and social clubs that provide students with a platform to explore their passions beyond academics. Technical clubs like <font color = "Black">the Robotics Forum, V-BUG (Linux User Group), and Team Veloce Racing</font> are highly active, participating in national competitions and fostering innovation. On the cultural front, clubs like Antarang manage major events and bring together students interested in music, drama, and dance.
